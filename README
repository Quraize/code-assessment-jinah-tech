Asslamo Alikum,
Hello there, I could not get the necessary API code snippets due to problems on my end provided by you. 
So I made both frontend and backend myself. And tried to build the most of the APIs with the best of my ability.
P.S. I can do much more with Reactjs and frontend if given the necessary time.

1-You have to run 'npm install' in both backend and frontend folders, saparateky.
2-Both, the frontend and backend, can be initiated, with 'npm run dev'.
